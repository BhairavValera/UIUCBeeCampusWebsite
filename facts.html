        <br>
        With pollinators such as bees experiencing rapid population decline across the United States,
        the importance in protecting their species, habitats,
        and the plants they utilize becomes vital to their survival.
        Partake in the movement of pollinator support by following these steps!
        <br>
        <br>
        Keep a Bee Garden! Plant a garden specifically designed to support your local pollinators!
      </factsBrief>

      <ul>
        <li>
        Native plants! Native plants! Native plants!
        <br>
        Incorporate plants, flowers, and shrubs that local pollinators love and that
        are native to your region! Native flowers and plants are the best way to
        support native pollinators and wildlife because they are compatible
        and recognizable to your local pollinators.
          <ul>
            <li>When choosing plants, choose large petals over small. Bees prefer flowers with large
            “landing pads” that give them easier access to pollen and nectar!</li>
            <li>Plant flowers in clusters rather than far apart, this will provide pollinators with the
            opportunity to easily move between flowers as well as provide shelter underneath plants
            in wind, rain, and storm.</li>
            <li>Plant a wide variety of flowers that bloom in multiple seasons for season-round
            pollinator support!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Pesticides… who needs ‘em!
          <ul>
            <li>Support natural garden pest consumers such as lady bugs, predatory wasps, and other
              insects whose diets consist of garden pests. Signs of these insects are the signs of a
              healthy garden. Not to mention, by supporting these natural pest-predators, you’re also
              supporting a major food source of local birds and wildlife!</li>
            <li>When necessary, the National Wildlife Federation recommends you “only use organic or
            natural pest deterrents such as soap, garlic and chili pepper.” in
            limited amounts.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Hydrate or Die-drate! (Acess to clean water!)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Bees don’t get all their water from nectar alone—provide a shallow bird bath as a clean
              water source, or a graveled muddy area in a corner of a garden or yard for pollinators to
              access fresh water.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
        Bees need homes too!
        <br>
        By incorporating these simple elements in your garden,
        you can easily provide shelter and cover for the
        native pollinators in your neighborhood!
          <ul>
            <li>
              Restrain from the use of mulch in your garden; many bees prefer to find shelter in loose
              soils or sands near the base of their food sources.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide small spaces for pollinators to nest such as decaying logs, trees, or branches.

    <div class="bottomNote">
      Remember, you do not need to replant your entire garden to support pollinators!
      Simply incorporating native and pollinator-friendly plant
      species between the current features of your garden will be
      enough to provide for pollinators.
      Adding these pollinator friendly features to do the trick!
