    <p> ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO
BERNARDO
Who's there?
FRANCISCO
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.<br>
BERNARDO
Long live the king!
FRANCISCO
Bernardo?
BERNARDO
He.<br>
FRANCISCO
You come most carefully upon your hour.<br>
BERNARDO
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.<br>
FRANCISCO
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.<br>
BERNARDO
Have you had quiet guard?
FRANCISCO
Not a mouse stirring.<br>
BERNARDO
Well, good night.<br>
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.<br>
FRANCISCO
I think I hear them.<br> Stand, ho! Who's there?
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

HORATIO
Friends to this ground.<br>
MARCELLUS
And liegemen to the Dane.<br>
FRANCISCO
Give you good night.<br>
MARCELLUS
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?
FRANCISCO
Bernardo has my place.<br>
Give you good night.<br>
Exit

MARCELLUS
Holla! Bernardo!
BERNARDO
Say,
What, is Horatio there?
HORATIO
A piece of him.<br>
BERNARDO
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.<br>
MARCELLUS
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
BERNARDO
I have seen nothing.<br>
MARCELLUS
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.<br>
HORATIO
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.<br><br>
BERNARDO
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.<br><br>
HORATIO
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.<br>
BERNARDO
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--
Enter Ghost

MARCELLUS
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
BERNARDO
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.<br>
MARCELLUS
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.<br>
BERNARDO
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.<br>
HORATIO
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.<br>
BERNARDO
It would be spoke to.<br>
MARCELLUS
Question it, Horatio.<br>
HORATIO
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
MARCELLUS
It is offended.<br>
BERNARDO
See, it stalks away!
HORATIO
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Exit Ghost

MARCELLUS
'Tis gone, and will not answer.<br>
BERNARDO
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
HORATIO
Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.<br>
MARCELLUS
Is it not like the king?
HORATIO
As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br>
'Tis strange.<br>
MARCELLUS
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.<br>
HORATIO
In what particular thought to work I know not;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.<br>
MARCELLUS
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?
HORATIO
That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so.<br> Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet.<br> Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
As it doth well appear unto our state--
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.<br>
BERNARDO
I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.<br>
HORATIO
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.<br>
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.<br>--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Re-enter Ghost

I'll cross it, though it blast me.<br> Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
Cock crows

If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.<br>
MARCELLUS
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
HORATIO
Do, if it will not stand.<br>
BERNARDO
'Tis here!
HORATIO
'Tis here!
MARCELLUS
