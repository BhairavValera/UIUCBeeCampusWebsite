      University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (U of I) is committed to environmental
      sustainability, and as part of our commitment we have implemented a thorough IPM plan to
      reduce our use of pesticides on the exterior of the main campus.
      <br>
      <br>
      This plan outlines the fundamental aspects of U of I’s IPM strategy.
      All U of I employees who apply pesticides go
      through rigorous training and education to become State Licensed Public Pesticide Operators or
      Applicators.
      <br>
      <br>
      This high level of training, along with monthly meetings ensures that our
      employees understand and follow our IPM strategy.

      IPM Fundamentals:
      <br>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div class="ipmFundamentals">
      <i><b>Acceptable pest levels:</b></i>
      <br>
      As an original land grant university, part of the educational
      mission is to expose students to a variety of situations in the landscape in which to learn and observe.
      Thus the emphasis at the university is on control of pests on campus, not eradication.
      <br>
      <br>
      IPM also holds that wiping out an entire pest population is often impossible,
      and the attempt can be expensive and environmentally unsafe.
      University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Facilities & Services typically only uses
      pesticide treatment for targeted turf maintenance.
      <br>
      <br>
      Insecticide usage is very limited and is generally utilized on small
      plantings of roses that are struggling with Japanese beetles. 
      U of I does not spray any insecticides or fungicides on our trees,
      and it is only used on landscape plants (shrubs, perennials, annuals, grass, etc.)
      if the pest has affected the plant to the point it is causing significant harm.
      <br>
      <br>
      Of note, U of I Facilities & Services (F&S) has not sprayed our trees for anything in approximately 15 years.
      In addition, F&S has removed all insecticide/herbicide use at the President’s House grounds (+/-7 acres)
      since May of 2015. It is our goal to keep these pests in check using a combination of methods,
      with pesticides being our last resort.
      <br>
      <br>

      <i><b>Preventive cultural practices:</b></i>
      <br>
      Selecting varieties best for local growing conditions and maintaining
      healthy crops is the first line of defense for optimum cultural practices.
      The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Facilities & Services Grounds
      department is working to move toward replacing
      our traditional Kentucky Bluegrass / Ryegrass mix in favor of a more durable
      Turf Type Tall Fescue mix in all lawn panels.
      This shift will allow for more sustainable irrigation practices,
      and more resistant lawns against foot traffic. During our summers,
      the fescue lawn will help to out compete weeds better than the bluegrass mix,
      thus offering a reducing on the use of herbicides on campus.
      <br>
      <br>
      In addition to choosing diverse and local crops to implement onto the main campus,
      techniques such as plant quarantine and crop sanitation (e.g. removal of diseased plants,
      and cleaning pruning shears to prevent spread of infections).
      F&S Grounds department removes leaves and herbaceous plant material that have died and
      transports it to their maintenance facility. The material is placed in windrows where it gets turned
      a few times each year until it has broken down into compost.
      F&S also removes any infected plants/trees and/or limbs identified on campus.
      <br>
      <br>

      <i><b>Monitoring:</b></i>
      <br>
      Regular observation is the cornerstone of IPM.
      Observation is broken into two steps, first; inspection and second; identification.
      <br>
      <br>
      The F&S Grounds department is consistently inspecting the different areas of campus;
      all of the staff are trained and knowledgeable on what to look for and how to identify
      the presence of pests. There are three main signs that pests have reached a level of economic and
      ecological threat:
      <ol class="monitoring">
        <li>
          When the plant is dying (e.g. turfgrass that is infected with grubs to the
          extent of large brown patches).
        </li>
        <li>
          When the plant is defoliating prematurely due to an insect infestation
          (defoliation from fungal reasons are treated with sanitation methods only).
        </li>
        <li>
          When a plant’s foliage is being eaten to a point where its aesthetics
          is being negatively affected (i.e. it is off color, not blooming, appears defoliated, etc.).
          If the plant or grass is in the historic core of campus and has aesthetic/marketing/intrinsic value,
          F&S would consider applying pesticides when any of the above is present.
        </li>
      </ol>
      In order to use pesticides/herbicides on campus, F&S staff is licensed by the
      Illinois Department of Agriculture every year. The license is valid from Jan 1 – through Dec 31 
      and must be renewed every year and retest is required every 3rd year.
      <br>
      <br>
      Employees attend what is called a “general standards training” before taking a thorough exam.
      Grounds Workers must have, at minimum, the general standards pesticide operator license
      and supervision must a pesticide applicator license by passing the general standards plus a category exam
      (turf, right of way, ornamental, and aquatics).
      <br>
      <br>
      This serves U of I well, as any Grounds worker can help to identify and call out
      pests and outbreaks on the campus.
      <br>
      <br>

      <i><b>Mechanical controls:</b></i>
      <br>
      Mechanical controls are typically a first line of defense in pest management.
      The previously mentioned sanitation, in addition to our mulch regiment greatly assist our management.
      F&S utilizes large amounts of green waste wood chips in the planter bed areas of campus to suppress weeds.
      Application of the wood chips helps to reduce the amount of germination from weed
      seeds in the soil while also moderating moisture.
      <br>
      <br>
      For difficult sites to maintain, a layer
      of crushed granite may be used in lieu of mulch or pavement to suppress weed growth.
      <br>
      <br>
      Should a pest reach an unacceptable level, mechanical methods are the first option,
      including using string trimmers to reduce the level of weed growth.
      <br>
      <br>
      As a public outreach program, U of I F&S is one of the sponsors of the Boneyard Creek Community Day. 
      The purpose of the event is “to engage the community in awareness and responsibility of naturalizing
      and sustaining our waterways through organized litter clean up, education and removal of
      invasive species to restore natural habitat and showcase the amenity value of a healthy ecosystem”.
      The university is able to leverage the public in assisting with mechanical controls of weed,
      as a part of a social and educational forum.
      <br>
      <br>

      <i><b>Biological controls:</b></i>
      <br>
      Natural biological processes and materials can provide control with minimal environmental impact,
      and often at lower cost. The focus here is to promote beneficial insects that eat or
      parasitize target pests. The U of I Facilities & Services planting designs incorporate specific
      types of flowering plants that attract predator insects, in order to naturally encourage an
      acceptable predator/pest balance.
      <br>
      <br>

      <i><b>Pesticides:</b></i>
      <br>
      On the U of I main campus, synthetic pesticides are used as required and often only at
      specific times in a pest’s life cycle. Many of the newer pesticide groups are derived
      from plants or naturally occurring substances (e.g. pyrethrum and insect juvenile hormone analogues),
      but the toxophore or active component may be altered to provide increased biological activity or
      stability.
      <br>
      <br>
      Applications of pesticides must reach their intended targets. Matching the
      application technique to the crop, the pest, and the pesticide is critical.
      The use of low-volume spray equipment reduces overall pesticide use and labor cost.
      <br>
      <br>
      The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign F & S Grounds department uses only the safest,
      lowest toxicity products possible for effective control of pests. Pesticide-use will comply with all local,
      state, and federal regulations. No “restricted use” pesticides will be used.
      <br>
      <br>
      The university is committed to encouraging and protecting pollinators, and therefore the
      F&S Grounds department only uses a limited amount of herbicides that contain neonicotinoids.
      Primarily it is used in the Main Quad’s lawn panels during high stress seasons.
      As they are used exclusively in a limited lawn panel area, and is in a granular form,
      impact to the local pollinator community is minimized.
      <br>
      <br>
      However, F&S will be trialing alternatives in 2018/2019 to find effective non neonicotinoids.
      At all locations of treatment areas, we will continue to post highly visible signs informing
      the public of what is being applied, where it is being applied, and when it is being applied.
